# Project Abstract

ObfuscatÅ«r is an interactive coded piece where users can find themselves built out of a grid of triangles. As the experience continues on, the triangles begin to change shape, further abstracting and obfuscating the user's view, changing it into something else entirely. This project explores how we look and to what extent we can recognize an abstraction of ourself as familiar.
